# Oswin So - #oswinso

Hi, I'm Oswin.

I'm currently an undergraduate researcher at the [Autonomous Decision Systems Laboratory](https://sites.gatech.edu/acds/) at Georgia Tech working on the areas of stochastic optimization and risk sensitive control.

I'm also the software core chair for [RoboJackets](https://robojackets.org), as well as a software member on our [RoboCup SSL](https://github.com/RoboJackets/robocup-software/) team. In the past, I was also the software lead for the [IGVC](https://github.com/RoboJackets/igvc-software) team.
